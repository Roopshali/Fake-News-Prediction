# Fake-News-Prediction
To determine if a news story is true or false, a prediction model employing logistic regression is built.

## Problem Statement-
Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning with Python.

## Introduction-
I was interested to learn that WhatsApp was removing 2 million accounts each month to stop the spread of false information. How many of the millions of accounts marked for deletion have been incorrectly labelled as false news? How did WhatsApp ever manage to develop an automatic system for purging millions of accounts with false news? 

## Aim of the project-
Our aim is to predict whether a news is fake or not using Logic Regression Model in Python by applying supervised Machine Learning.

## Insights on Logistic Regression Model-
A statistical analysis approach called logistic regression uses previous observations from a data set to predict a binary result, such as yes or no. It is a very effective and straightforward machine learning classification technique that was adapted from statistical algorithms.
The sigmoid function, which has the form of the letter "S," is a mathematical function that has the ability to transfer any real number to a range between 0 and 1. Another name for it is a logistic function.

## Dataset-
I utilised the Kaggle dataset for this research. Here is where you can download it: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data
